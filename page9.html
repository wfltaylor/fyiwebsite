                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style">To create a hardware product, you must plan very well. Each single component, each circuit, everything must be planned before you even think of buying or even designing anything. Once you have planned your product, you must design it. The software I researched and learned about was Fusion 360. After the design is finished, you must buy the components that you need and start creating you design.
<br>Without proper planning, you could waste lots of time and money. To plan my drone, I created a BOM (bill of materials – a list of everything that your project will require) and did a few sketches of my drone. I then created a schematic of all of the circuits that my drone requires.
<br>To actually create the design, I used the Fusion 360 software. As part of my research I found that this software is based on ‘sketches’. Each ‘sketch’ is a 2D drawing which then you can create into a 3D design through an extrude or another tool. This software requires lots of patience and practice to create a good design as it’s complex tools take awhile to get used to.
<br>To actually physically create my drone, I used a 3D printer to print each of the plastic parts. I researched lots of different techniques to make 3D prints strong, and the best materials to use. Some techniques include increasing the infill and perimeters, using a big layer height, and printing in the correct orientation. The material I used in the end was called NylonX as from my research it seemed like it was the strongest non-toxic material to print.
<br>I feel confident that my project has improved my knowledge of creating hardware devices through the three subject areas I researched; Technology, Maths, and Humanities. I also feel confident that I have learned lots about how drones work and what they could do in the future.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    Reflection</h1>
                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style">Towards the start of my project, I had a very large amount of ideas about what to do and what my creative should be. They ranged from making an Android app, a security camera, even creating my own microcontroller. I first narrowed down what I should do to making hardware of some-sort. I had always wanted to have a cool drone for flying around and taking pictures, so I finally decided on making a drone. 
<br>Once I had brainstormed what research questions I was going to do I started researching. Although some questions had a large amount of information on the internet about them I found that for most of my questions there was no, or barely any information about them. I also tried looking for a book relevant to my topic in the school library, but I was unable to locate anything useful.
<br>When it came to creating my website, I used Mobirise. I had used this software before for another school project so I was fairly good at using it. I also added a quiz in the technology page of my website to test people’s knowledge. In the end, my website came out looking fairly professional that I was happy with.
<br>The biggest challenge I had with creating my creative (the drone) was the microcontroller I used communicating with the controller for the motors. This took quite awhile to figure out – I ended up reverse engineering a commercial product.
<br>I was able to do most of my research in the FYI double period as I worked productively. I did have to spend some time at home working on my creative and my website. Overall, I enjoyed doing this project.&nbsp;<br></p>
